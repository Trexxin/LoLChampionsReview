# LoLChampionsReview
An simple api for reviewing League of Legends champions and their Regions using Asp.net, Entity Framwork, and Swagger. The api grants the ability to get, put, update, and delete entities with a script to seed a starter database. 

Was made to get extra practice with the web api creation process.
